# Fake-News-Detection

## Overview of the Problem
The problem of unreliable news being spread rapidly digitally with next to no fact-checking is a immense problem and results in the rampant spread of misinformation. The negative effects of fake news range from uncertainty in the fairness of elections, to damage to the reputation and profitability of individuals and corporations. Market research indicates that as much as \$39 billion is lost annually as a result of uncontrolled fake news\cite{cost}. This large issues establishes a large monetary and societal motivation for the development of effective techniques to detect this issue.

Natural Language Processing techniques have been of great interest to mitigating the effects of fake-news \cite{KHAN2021100032}. The development of such solutions, provide at times super-human levels of fake-news detection with the scalability to scan large portions of the internet. In this project, we will introduce a novel technique to detect fake news built upon existing work in NLP.
